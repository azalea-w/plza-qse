## What's this?
A *very* simple save editor for PLZA for changing gender and Trainer ID using [plza-save-utils](https://github.com/azalea-w/plza-save-utils)


## Dependencies
- Python 3.13 (other versions of Python 3 should work too)

## How to use

1. Dump your save file using JKSV or similar
2. Copy your save file to your PC
3. Download latest release ZIP from the [Releases](https://github.com/azalea-w/plza-qse/releases) Section
4. Open your shell (powershell or cmd for windows)
5. Run the Script like `python <path/to/main.py>`!

It will output a new file with `_modified` appended to the filename, just restore that save using JKSV or similar and you should be good to go!
